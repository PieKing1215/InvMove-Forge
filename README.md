# InvMove
### Minecraft Forge mod that adds the ability to walk around while in inventories

![](demo/InvMove-0.2.0.gif)

Allows for moving, jumping, sprinting, etc. from within inventories.

Also disables the darkened background in inventories that don't pause the game.

Both features should work with all vanilla inventories, and can be toggled on or off per-inventory in the config menu.

This mod is client-side, but it may raise alarms if used on servers with anticheat.
I take no responsibility if you get banned or something because you used this on public servers.

Made after [I couldn't find an existing mod for this](https://redd.it/egwe8w).

### [Releases](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/releases)

Requires [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config-forge) so the config screen works.

## Usage

Feel free to use in packs if you wish (though compatibility hasn't been tested thoroughly)

Tested on Forge 31.2.0 with MC 1.15.2, on both singleplayer and multiplayer.

The mod is licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](LICENSE.md)

## Upcoming
- 0.4.0 - Mod compatibility
  - Explicit support for certain mods
  - Indirect support for many other mods by detecting unrecognized UI types and adding them to the config dynamically.
