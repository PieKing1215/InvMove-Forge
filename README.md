# InvMove
### Minecraft Forge mod that adds the ability to walk around while in inventories

Allows for moving, sprinting, jumping, etc. from within inventories.

Also disables the darkened background in inventories that don't pause the game.

Both features should work with all vanilla inventories, and can be toggled on or off per-inventory in the config file.
